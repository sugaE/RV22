% *Question 2.1*	
% 
% Implement a function to apply any difference of Gaussian filter to an image. 
% It should be possible to give the size of the filter in pixels, and the parameters 
% of the two Gaussian, as inputs to the function. You may use existing MATLAB 
% functions for filtering but must write your own code to generate difference 
% of Gaussian kernels. Implement a default set of parameters for the two Gaussian 
% that approximates the Laplacian of the Gaussian in the case where the only input 
% given to the function is the size of the filter in pixels. Apply a 15 Ã— 15 difference 
% of Gaussian filter to the accompanying three images (see above) using your function 
% and show your results.

% *Question 2.2*
% 
% Implement a function to apply difference of Gaussian filters to an image at 
% different scales to produce a set of filtered images forming a scale-space pyramid. 
% Apply your function to the accompanying three images (see above) and show the 
% different scales produced by your function.

dog_mp=dogwithscale(malards_park, size_of_g, 0, 0.8, "q2.2_mp");
%% 
% *Question 2.3*
% 
% Implement a function to search a scale-space pyramid and identify strong filter 
% responses. Assume that each of the strong filter responses corresponds to a 
% feature of interest in the image. The function should return the properties 
% of each of the features, which should consist of the position and scale that 
% maximises the filter response. Apply your function to the accompanying three 
% images (see above) and show your results by overlaying the feature positions 
% and sizes on the original images.

%% 
% *Question 2.4*
% 
% Implement a function to examine the image neighbourhood of a feature and estimate 
% the orientation of the feature. The scale of the feature should be taken into 
% account when estimating the orientation. Apply your function to the accompanying 
% three images (see above) and show your results by overlaying the feature positions,
